v0.1 Draft — March 2026

Companion to: All spec documents

---

## 1. Phase Model

The architecture defined two milestones (v0.1, v1.0). The mobile spec defined four (v0.1, v0.2, v1.0, v2.0+). The mobile spec is canonical. This document reconciles both into a single timeline.

### 1.1 Why Four Phases

The architecture was written before the mobile-first strategy existed. Its two milestones assumed a desktop-only product. The mobile spec introduced a PDS-as-full-PDS phase that precedes any desktop involvement. The four-phase model reflects the actual build order:

1. **v0.1** — PDS is a full PDS. User creates identity from phone, logs into Bluesky.
2. **v0.2** — Desktop enrolls. PDS becomes a proxy+signer. Device management from phone.
3. **v1.0** — Recovery, polish, production readiness. BYO PDS support.
4. **v2.0+** — Signing sovereignty. Contingent on ATProto protocol evolution.

### 1.2 Timeline Estimates

| Phase | Duration | Cumulative |
|-------|----------|------------|
| v0.1 | 3–4 months | 3–4 months |
| v0.2 | 2–3 months | 5–7 months |
| v1.0 | 3–4 months | 8–11 months |
| v2.0+ | TBD | TBD |

Solo developer estimates from architecture spec. v0.2 is new — estimated at 2–3 months based on scope (device pairing, desktop promotion, XRPC proxying).

## 2. Phase Details

### 2.1 v0.1 — Mobile-Only PDS

**Goal:** User creates an ATProto identity from their iPhone and logs into Bluesky.

**Lifecycle phase:** Mobile-Only. PDS is a full PDS — hosts repo, serves XRPC, signs commits, emits firehose.

#### PDS

| Component | Description | Source |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Axum HTTP server | Serves all endpoints | architecture |
| SQLite database | Accounts, repos, tokens, OAuth state | architecture |
| Repo engine | CAR file storage, Merkle tree, commit signing | architecture |
| Signing key management | P-256 key generation, Secure Enclave on phone stores root rotation key | mobile §3 |
| XRPC endpoints | `com.atproto.*` read + write | architecture |
| Firehose emitter | Native event stream (not proxy — PDS IS the PDS) | cross-spec §2.6 |
| Iroh tunnel | NAT traversal for phone ↔ PDS | mobile §5 |

#### OAuth (blocks Bluesky login)

| POST /v1/sessions | Session creation (login) | provisioning §2 |
| POST /v1/pds/keys | Generate PDS signing key | mobile §9 |

#### Identity & Keys

| Component | Description | Source |

| Key types | P-256 for rotation key, P-256/secp256k1 for signing | cross-spec §1.1 |
| Shamir share generation | 2-of-3 split during onboarding. Share 1 = iCloud Keychain, Share 2 = PDS escrow, Share 3 = user's choice | cross-spec §2.5 |

#### Migration

| Component | Description | Source |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Planned device swap | LAN transfer via Iroh, 6-digit code | migration §3 |

#### XRPC Federation Surface (minimum viable endpoint set)

The following XRPC endpoints are the minimum required for the PDS to join the ATProto network as a federating PDS. Derived from @threddyrex.org's C# PDS implementation (the first non-reference PDS to successfully federate) and cross-referenced with the ATProto spec.

**com.atproto.repo — Repo CRUD + blobs (8 endpoints)**

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `com.atproto.repo.createRecord` | POST | Create a record in a repo collection |
| `com.atproto.repo.putRecord` | POST | Write a record (create or update) |
| `com.atproto.repo.deleteRecord` | POST | Delete a record |
| `com.atproto.repo.applyWrites` | POST | Batch write (create/update/delete) |
| `com.atproto.repo.getRecord` | GET | Fetch a single record by key |
| `com.atproto.repo.listRecords` | GET | List records in a collection |
| `com.atproto.repo.describeRepo` | GET | Repo metadata (DID, handle, collections) |
| `com.atproto.repo.uploadBlob` | POST | Upload a blob, returns CID ref |

**com.atproto.server — Auth + account lifecycle (6 endpoints)**

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `com.atproto.server.createSession` | POST | Login (returns access + refresh tokens) |
| `com.atproto.server.getSession` | GET | Validate current session |
| `com.atproto.server.refreshSession` | POST | Rotate session tokens |
| `com.atproto.server.describeServer` | GET | Server capabilities + invite policy |
| `com.atproto.server.activateAccount` | POST | Activate a deactivated account |
| `com.atproto.server.deactivateAccount` | POST | Deactivate account (preserves data) |

**com.atproto.sync — Federation surface (7 endpoints)**

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `com.atproto.sync.getRepo` | GET | Full repo export (CAR file) |
| `com.atproto.sync.getRecord` | GET | Single record as CAR-encoded block |
| `com.atproto.sync.getBlob` | GET | Fetch blob by CID |
| `com.atproto.sync.listBlobs` | GET | List blob CIDs for a repo |
| `com.atproto.sync.listRepos` | GET | List all repos hosted by this PDS |
| `com.atproto.sync.getRepoStatus` | GET | Repo sync status (active/deactivated) |
| `com.atproto.sync.subscribeRepos` | WS | Firehose — WebSocket event stream of repo commits |

**com.atproto.identity (1 endpoint)**

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `com.atproto.identity.resolveHandle` | GET | Resolve handle → DID |

**app.bsky.* — Appview proxy (not implemented locally)**

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `app.bsky.*` (catch-all) | * | Proxy to Bluesky appview (bsky.network) |
| `app.bsky.actor.getPreferences` | GET | Stored locally — survives appview outages |
| `app.bsky.actor.putPreferences` | POST | Stored locally |

**chat.bsky.convo (2 endpoints)**

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|

| `chat.bsky.convo.listConvos` | GET | List chat conversations |

**Infrastructure (1 endpoint)**

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/_health` | GET | Liveness check |

**Total: 25 XRPC endpoints + health check.** This is the federation acceptance test — if these all work correctly, the PDS is a functioning PDS on the network.

Note: `app.bsky.*` calls are proxied to the appview, not implemented locally. The PDS only stores preferences locally. The `chat.bsky.convo` endpoints may also be proxied depending on whether ezpds hosts chat state or defers to a chat service.

## 3. Cross-Document Phase Mapping

How each document's milestones map to the unified phases:

| Unified Phase | Architecture | Mobile | Provisioning | Migration | OAuth | Blobs |
|---------------|-------------|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|-------|
| **v0.1** | v0.1 (technical preview) | iOS v0.1 (identity wallet) | Core endpoints | v0.1 (planned swap) | v0.1 (basic OAuth) | v0.1 (basic blobs) |
| **v0.2** | — (not represented) | iOS v0.2 (device mgmt) | Device endpoints | — | — (no changes) | Desktop blob sync |
| **v1.0** | v1.0 (public launch) | iOS v1.0 (recovery) | Full API + milestones | v1.0 (full recovery) | v1.0 (production) | v1.0 (production) |
| **v2.0+** | — | v2.0+ (signing sovereignty) | PLC authority | Multi-device sync | Later | Later |

### 3.1 Architecture Gap

The architecture document has no v0.2 milestone. It needs a "Phase 1: Desktop Enrollment" between its technical preview and public launch. The architecture's v0.1 scope includes some items that belong in v0.2 (device pairing, desktop promotion).

### 3.2 Provisioning API Gap

The provisioning API has no milestone tags at all. Every endpoint group needs a phase assignment. The 17 endpoints from the mobile and migration specs need to be integrated and tagged.

## 4. Dependency Graph

Critical path items that block subsequent phases:

```
v0.1 Critical Path:
  Axum server → SQLite schema → Repo engine → XRPC endpoints
                                            → OAuth (blocks Bluesky login)
                                            → Blob upload/serve
                → DID creation → Account creation → Shamir split
                → Iroh tunnel (blocks device transfer)

v0.2 Critical Path:
  v0.1 complete → Device pairing protocol → Desktop promotion
                → XRPC proxy layer → Commit signing endpoint
                → Firehose proxy
                → Blob forwarding via Iroh

v1.0 Critical Path:
  v0.2 complete → Recovery ceremony → Shamir reconstruction
                → Tier pricing → BYO PDS packaging
                → S3 migration → CDN setup
                → PostgreSQL option
```

## 6. Action Items

This document resolves cross-spec-analysis items:

- **#7** (architecture: move basic Shamir to v0.1) — Resolved: Shamir split is in v0.1 (§2.1)
- **#8** (architecture: add unified milestone map) — This document
- **#14** (provisioning: add milestone tags) — Phase assignments listed in §2.1–2.4
- **#23** (new document: unified milestone map) — This document

### Remaining updates needed in individual documents

The architecture (items 1–6), provisioning API (items 9–13, 15), migration spec (items 16–18), and mobile spec (items 19–20) still need their own text updated to reference these unified phases. Those are separate action items tracked in [archive/cross-spec-analysis.md](archive/cross-spec-analysis.md).
